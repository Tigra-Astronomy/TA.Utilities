# Timtek Utilities

Welcome to the Obsidian vault for TA.Utilities documentation.

- This vault is the single source of truth for project docs.
- GitHub Actions builds the site with MkDocs + Material and publishes with mike to GitHub Pages.
- Versioning policy:
  - Tags on master/main -> published as the tagged version and aliased to latest.
  - develop -> published/aliased as alpha.
  - release/* -> published/aliased as beta.

Start by adding Markdown notes here. Folders and pages you add under this directory will appear in the siteâ€™s navigation (per mkdocs.yml nav, or auto if you expand it).
